Installation instructions

technologies used
 javascript feature 1: The navbar is interactive and uses an eventlistener to disapear when paged is scrolled down and reapear when page is scrolled up 

javascript feature 2: when the headers "About me", "Resume", and "Projects" have a mouse hover over it the text enlarges and underlines with the use of event listeners. 


 javascript feature 3: when one of the headers "About me", "Resume", and "Projects" is clicked it drops down more information 

I used bootstrap card groups for the projects drop down, I am gonna populate those with projects in the future



 

aproach taken
I went for a one page design that uses a interactive navbar to bring you to where you click, i want to eventuallly update the css and html to make it look more appealing. I kinda freestyled the design a little bit and just designed as i went along, I did stick to my plan for most part.

unsolved problems -->
when the texts of headers enlarges from mouse hovering it can mess with the navbar because it will think you are scrolling up or down
I want to continue to style and improve this project over the next few weeks
